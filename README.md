This is a program that plays "Orteil Dashnet Cookie Clicker" game on the browser and automatically click the cookie. The program also buys the upgrades in the game. I've written this program to learn about Selenium.

To run the app you probably need to download selenium library from "pip install selenium". And you will also need to download "Chrome Driver" and have it in "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/chromedriver.exe", or change the location in the codes. 

In 02/02/2024, currently it's working perfectly fine. But with the updates in the game or selenium library this program may not work in the future.
